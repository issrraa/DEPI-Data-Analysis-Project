# Hospital Management Analytics

## ðŸ“Œ Project Idea
The project aims to build an interactive dashboard to analyze hospital management data.
Main focus areas:
1- Financial performance: Revenue trends, denials, self-pay analysis.
2- Clinical insights: Procedures, medications, and encounters.
3- Patient analytics: Demographics, age groups, geography.
4- Provider analytics: Workload, efficiency, and performance tracking.
Designed for decision makers (hospital managers, finance team, medical directors).

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1- Data Consolidation: Collect & clean hospital data (patients, visits, financial, labs, providers).
2- KPI Tracking: Define and monitor KPIs (e.g., total patients, revenue, denial rate, LOS).
3- Interactive Dashboard: Create a user-friendly template with cards, slicers, and chart placeholders.
4- Decision Support: Provide actionable insights (top diagnoses, revenue trends, provider productivity).
5- Scalability: Template can be expanded to Power BI / Tableau in the future.
