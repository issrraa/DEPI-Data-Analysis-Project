# Hospital Management Analysis 

## ðŸ“Œ Project Idea

Build an interactive hospital management dashboard using Excel (or Power BI / Tableau later).

Dashboard provides quick insights into:

Patients demographics & visits.

Encounters & diagnoses trends.

Financial performance (claims, billing, payments).

Procedures & lab tests distribution.

Providers performance.

Designed for decision makers (hospital managers, finance team, medical directors).

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1- Data Consolidation: Collect & clean hospital data (patients, visits, financial, labs, providers).

2- KPI Tracking: Define and monitor KPIs (e.g., total patients, revenue, denial rate, LOS).

3- Interactive Dashboard: Create a user-friendly template with cards, slicers, and chart placeholders.

4- Decision Support: Provide actionable insights (top diagnoses, revenue trends, provider productivity).

5- Scalability: Template can be expanded to Power BI / Tableau in the future.
